# Insurance_Provider
My project name is Insurance Provider where I have created a User And Admin Modules and performed CRUD operations using Python and MySQL. Data entered by the user are stored in MYSQL database in tabular form. The Best Part of this code is that it is 100 % user friendly because of excess use of exceptional handling.
